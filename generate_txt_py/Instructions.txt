Instruction on how to use the script : 

- download the json file from the Moonboard official site
	(further instructions regarding this step will be provided)
	
- depending on the set of holds you want to use, edit the `setB` variable in the pyton file 

- run the script by typing `python3 generate_code.py` in the terminal (Linux)
  or run it in your IDE of choice
  
- the output files of the script are  
	> STM32_code.txt 	  : contains the switch/case in C language to be 
             			    copied and pasted for the STM32 
	> filtered_problems.json : contains the filtered problems from the original json file. 
       			    The problem ID matches the one in the txt file. 
		    		    A new field called 'Sended' has been added (=false by default)
